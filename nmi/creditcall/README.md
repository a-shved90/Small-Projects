## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### About the project
```
I've build the app using Vue, and in interest of saving time on styling used \Vuetify framework that comes with premade styled components and leverages Vue \for functionality I'll need.
\I've made my main focus to demonstrate reusability and flexibility of some \elements that could be used to move this prototype to finished product. \Specifically mainBtn and infoPanel components that are being used on multiple \occasions throughout the project come with props that can be filled from any \place in the project, and styling them will propagate throughout the app.
\I've laid groundwork for slide panels to be reusable too, replacing their \content with something other than forms is easily done by passing props too.
```

### Given more time
```
\I would expand on reusability of infoPanel, passing data to it instead of \props, making its text and images dynamic.
\Also I would unify sliders into one and make them more flexible just like \infoPanel. This would greatly enhance reusability. 
```

### Areas site design can be enhanced further
```
\Design allows for some very subtle but eye-catching elements such as \interactive map, or even a basic SVG map with individual interactive elements.
\Banner graphic could be done with canvas/webGL and make dots and lines move in \random pattern to breath a bit more life to the site.
\Individual images could also be converted to svg and have a looping pattern to \them.
```

## Afterword
```
\I could have demonstrated more html/css skills, but focused more on framework \skills as this seems of a bigger significance in modern web world. _However_ I \do aknowledge a tremendous importance of semantics and clean CSS, so for a \better example here's a link to something I've done before that\ [better showcases my html/css skills](http://shved.co.uk/new/portfolio.html)
