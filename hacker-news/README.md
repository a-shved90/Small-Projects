# hacker-news

## Summary

```
Vuejs app using Axios that pull in hacker news API and populates a grid of boxes.
Grid is semi-dynamically generated from scss loop, which can definitely be improved, some bugs for sure.
Can probably be done better with flexbox, but wanted to try something newer, with more time could be polished up.
Some basic styling, active state showing more info, minimal responsiveness.
TDD demonstrated to a degree, but initial approach to data generation stopped me from implementing TDD properly.
Hit and miss project but a lot of fun:D
