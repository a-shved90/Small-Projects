## Summary

1. Spent roughly 10 hours on this, main time drain was the library I chose to use, D3JS is pretty big and complex, I haven't touched it for a few years and it took a bit of time to get it to work.
2. Enjoyed untangling the mess of tutorials and code snippets, few of them were compatible and a lot needed tweaking and editing, sifting through documentation to get them to gel. Importing calc function and assembly an array was the most fun in the project.
3. D3JS follows enter/update/exit pattern, but I only realized that closed to the finish, thus the graph doesnt update correctly. It does append 'g' on dataset change, but the svg itself isnt reacting, need a few more hours to wrap it up. Same applies to value inputs - dataset does change, but graph doesnt reflect that. :shipit:
4. It needs some styling, make hover values more visible, remove dots and apply hover values to the line itself. I wanted to do years starting from todays date, and adding years from input, and splitting the number using D3JS functions to see months/years, but left it for later cleanup. Same for Â£ axis. And obvs finishing the core fuctionality of this.
